# LangTrainerPy
A more simple version of what my LangTrainer desktop app was aiming to be...

Features
- the user can specify --coverage x% to specify that in that given training session, a total coverage of x% of all the conjugations/declensions for all of the vocab for the specified language will be chosen before the session is ended and the script returns prints out the stats for that session (% correct/wrong etc etc).
- there should also be a --free-practice mode, where there is no coverage target for the vocab, instead the user can just keep practicing over and over until they terminate the program manually. Not sure if stats should be tracked in this case? Maybe only per practice session, track long term stats separately to with-coverage stats? Needs thinking...
- More advanced features to come...

- add an evaluation mode with a default sample of vocab to get people started who have stumbled upon this project. Add --demo or something with common/basic vocab that most learners are bound to know, that way they can quickly check it out and go from there.
- should probably contain two yaml files, one is the standard user-specific file that contains all the metadata specific to the individual user (that is gitignored since it's specific to the user and of interest to nobody else), whilst the other *should* be included in the git index and it should contain the (simplified) grammar construct for each supported language... This way the universal grammar yaml (call it the gramml) is tracked and it is available for everyone who stumbles upon the project...
